The notes application was created from inspiration of the miui notes application, to help showcase my focus and skills in developing meticulous native android applications with a focus on:-

1.Architectural design and proficiency in clean architecture.

2.Dependency injection using Dagger Hilt.

3.Local database implementation(using Room)

4.MVVM.

5.Unit, Integration & UI testing using JUnit 4.

6.Efficient configuration changes and automatic support for both dark and light mode.

7.Android resource handling and implementation.
